applicable providing entity is hereinafter  referred  to  as
"CITRIX"). Your location of receipt of  the  Citrix  product
(hereinafter   "PRODUCT")   and   maintenance   (hereinafter

AGREEMENT. IF  YOU  DO  NOT  AGREE  TO  THE  TERMS  OF  THIS
AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL AND/OR USE THE  PRODUCT.   Nothing
contained in  any  purchase  order  or  any  other  document
submitted by you shall in any  way  modify  or  add  to  the
terms and conditions contained in this AGREEMENT.

1.    PRODUCT LICENSES.

a.    End User Licenses. The software in a software  PRODUCT
and the software installed in an appliance PRODUCT  is  made
available by CITRIX under the license models  identified  at
http://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/product.html.        Any
experimental features delivered with such software  will  be
identified  and  are  licensed  only  for  internal  testing
purposes.  "Software"  means  a  Citrix  proprietary  and/or
open source software program in object  code  form  licensed
hereunder.  "Appliance"  means  a  hardware  appliance  with
installed Software. Notwithstanding anything  set  forth  in
this AGREEMENT or at the referenced  website,  your  use  of
Open Source  Software  shall  in  all  ways  be  exclusively
governed by the open source license indicated as  applicable
to  the  code  at  http://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/open-
source.html. "Open Source Software" means those portions  of
the PRODUCT that are provided under an open  source  license
(e.g., a version of a GNU General Public License, BSD  or  a
license  similar  to  those  approved  by  the  Open  Source
Initiative (http://opensource.org)).

Your license to software in a software or appliance  PRODUCT
will be activated by license keys  that  allow  use  of  the
PRODUCT  in  increments  defined  by   the   license   model
purchased ("License Keys"). License Keys  for  other  CITRIX
products or other editions of the same PRODUCT  may  not  be
used to increase the allowable use for your edition  of  the
PRODUCT.

b.     Partner  Demo.  If  a  software  PRODUCT  is  labeled
"Partner Demo," notwithstanding any term to the contrary  in
this AGREEMENT, your license permits use only if you  are  a
current CITRIX authorized distributor or reseller, and  then
only for demonstration,  test,  or  evaluation  purposes  in
support of your end-user customers, and not  for  any  other
purpose, including without limitation customer  training  or
production purposes. Note that a Partner  Demo  PRODUCT  may
disable itself upon the expiration of the  License  Key.  In
no  event  may  a  Partner  Demo  PRODUCT  be  used   beyond
expiration.

c.     Evaluation.  If  a  software   PRODUCT   is   labeled
"Evaluation," notwithstanding any term to  the  contrary  in
this AGREEMENT, your license permits use only if you are  an
end-user  customer  and  then   only   for   your   internal
demonstration, test, or evaluation  purposes,  and  not  for
any other purpose, including without  limitation  production
purposes. Your license is  for  ninety  (90)  days  with  no
right to MAINTENANCE, the Limited Warranty, or  Infringement
Indemnification.  Note  that  an  Evaluation   PRODUCT   may
disable itself upon the expiration of the  License  Key.  In
no  event  may  an  Evaluation  PRODUCT   be   used   beyond
expiration.

d.    Archive Copy.  You  may  make  one  (1)  copy  of  the
software in a software  or  appliance  PRODUCT  in  machine-
readable  form  solely  for  back-up,  provided   that   you
reproduce all proprietary notices on the copy.

2.    MAINTENANCE. The MAINTENANCE plan applicable  to  this
PRODUCT             is             identified             at
http://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/product.html  and   plan
entitlements   and    requirements    are    explained    at
https://www.citrix.com/support/programs.html.    MAINTENANCE
may be required at the time  of  PRODUCT  purchase  and  may
need to be purchased separately.  MAINTENANCE  is  available
for an initial (1) year term and may  be  extended  by  your
purchase of  available  annual  renewals  (the  "MAINTENANCE
Term"). MAINTENANCE for  a  software  or  appliance  PRODUCT
begins upon  delivery  of  the  License  Keys.   During  the
initial or a renewal MAINTENANCE Term, CITRIX will make  any
Updates for the PRODUCT covered by  the  plan  available  to
you. An "Update" shall mean a  generally  available  release
of the same edition of the software  for  the  same  PRODUCT
which Citrix may make available from time  to  time.  CITRIX
is not obligated to  make  any  Updates  available.  Updates
shall be subject to the  terms  of  this  AGREEMENT,  except
that  Updates  are  not  covered  by  the  Limited  Warranty
applicable to  the  PRODUCT,  to  the  extent  permitted  by
applicable law. You acknowledge that CITRIX may develop  and
market new or different software or appliance  offerings  or
editions of the PRODUCT that use  portions  of  the  PRODUCT
and that perform all or part of the functions  performed  by
the PRODUCT. Nothing contained in this AGREEMENT shall  give
you any  rights  with  respect  to  such  new  or  different
offerings  or  editions.  The  MAINTENANCE   plan   may   be
purchased for the PRODUCT until it is no longer  offered  in
accordance with  the  applicable  CITRIX  PRODUCT  Lifecycle
Support             Policy             posted             at
http://www.citrix.com/support/product-lifecycle.html.    Any
deliveries of Updates shall be electronic.  The  MAINTENANCE
plan may include technical support and, for  hardware  only,
an   extended    hardware    warranty,    if    stated    at
https://www.citrix.com/support/programs.html.  The  offering
you purchase determines your  entitlement.  In  addition  to
your  MAINTENANCE  plan,  you  may  also   purchase   CITRIX
consulting  services  as   may   be   available   (including
installation  services,  remote   monitoring   services   or
technical  consulting).  CITRIX'  provision   of   technical
support  or  consulting  services  is  predicated  upon  the
following responsibilities being fulfilled by you:  (i)  you
will designate a Customer Support Manager ("CSM")  who  will
be the primary administrative contact;  (ii)  you  agree  to
perform reasonable problem determination activities  and  to
perform  reasonable   problem   resolution   activities   as
suggested  by  CITRIX;  (iii)  you   are   responsible   for
implementing   procedures   necessary   to   safeguard   the
integrity  and  security   of   software   and   data   from
unauthorized access  and  for  reconstructing  any  lost  or
altered files resulting  from  catastrophic  failures;  (iv)
you  are  responsible   for   procuring,   installing,   and
maintaining all equipment, telephone  lines,  communications
interfaces, and other hardware at your  site  and  providing
CITRIX  with  access  to  your  facilities  as  required  to
operate the PRODUCT and permitting  CITRIX  to  perform  the
service;  and  (v)  you  are  required  to   implement   all
currently  available  and  applicable   software   hotfixes,
hotfix rollup packs, and service packs or  their  equivalent
for the PRODUCT in a timely manner. CITRIX is  not  required
to provide any technical support for  problems  arising  out
of: (i) your or any third party's alterations  or  additions
to  the  PRODUCT,  operating  system  or  environment;  (ii)
CITRIX provided alterations  or  additions  to  the  PRODUCT
that  do  not  address   Errors   or   Defects;   (ii)   any
functionality  not  defined  in   the   user   documentation
published  by  CITRIX  and   included   with   the   PRODUCT
(hereinafter  "Documentation");  (iii)  use  of  a  software
PRODUCT  on  a  processor  or  peripherals  other  than  the
processor and  peripherals  defined  in  the  Documentation;
(iv) any PRODUCT that has reached End-of-Life; and  (v)  any
consulting  deliverables  from  CITRIX,  you  or  any  third
party. An "Error" is defined as a failure in the PRODUCT  to
materially conform  to  the  functionality  defined  in  the
documentation. A "Defect" is defined as  a  failure  in  the
PRODUCT  to   conform   to   the   specifications   in   the
Documentation. In situations where CITRIX cannot  provide  a
satisfactory resolution to  your  critical  problem  through
normal technical support  methods,  CITRIX  may  engage  its
product development team to create a  private  fix.  Private
fixes are designed to address your  specific  situation  and
may not be further distributed by you.  CITRIX  retains  all
right, title, and interest in and to all  fixes,  packs  and
their equivalent. Any private fixes are not provided as  the
PRODUCT under the terms of this AGREEMENT and they  are  not
covered   by   the   Limited   Warranty   or    Infringement
Indemnification applicable to the  PRODUCT,  to  the  extent
permitted  by  applicable  law.  With  respect   to   CITRIX
consulting services, all  intellectual  property  rights  in
all deliverables, pre-existing works  and  derivative  works
of such pre-existing works, as well  as  developments  made,
conceived, created,  discovered,  invented,  or  reduced  to
practice in the performance of the assessment are and  shall
remain the sole and absolute property of CITRIX, subject  to
a worldwide, non-exclusive license to you for internal  use.
Except for your payment obligations  for  provided  PRODUCTS
and services,  non-performance  of  either  party  shall  be
excused to the extent performance is rendered impossible  by
force majeure, but  only  for  so  long  as  such  condition
exists.

3.     DESCRIPTION  OF  OTHER   RIGHTS,   LIMITATIONS,   AND
OBLIGATIONS. Except as expressly set forth  in  Section  13,
you may not transfer, rent, timeshare, grant  rights  in  or
lease the  PRODUCT  except  to  the  extent  such  foregoing
restriction is prohibited by applicable  mandatory  law.  If
you purchased  or  otherwise  received  replacement  License
Keys as part of a PRODUCT  upgrade  or  otherwise  and  such
replacement is a condition of the transaction, you agree  to
destroy the original  License  Keys  and  retain  no  copies
after installation of the new License Keys and PRODUCT.  You
shall provide the serial numbers  of  the  original  License
Keys and  corresponding  replacement  License  Keys  to  the
reseller  and,  upon  request,  directly  to   CITRIX,   for
tracking purposes. In the event you make a transfer  of  the
PRODUCT in the EU or EER, to the  extent  permitted  by  law
and notwithstanding the terms of this  AGREEMENT,  you  must
uninstall the PRODUCT and  License  Keys,  cease  your  use,
transfer them to the transferee and retain  no  copies.  You
are responsible for ensuring  that  the  transferee  accepts
the terms of this AGREEMENT. You must provide evidence  that
the conditions for a lawful  transfer  of  the  PRODUCT  are
met.    All   warranty,   MAINTENANCE    and    infringement
indemnification rights  will  terminate  automatically  upon
such transfer and will not be available to  the  transferee.
You must comply with applicable export laws with respect  to
such a transfer. You  may  not  modify,  translate,  reverse
engineer, decompile, disassemble,  create  derivative  works
based on or copy the PRODUCT, except as  expressly  licensed
in  this  AGREEMENT  or  to  the   extent   such   foregoing
restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable  mandatory
law. You may not remove any proprietary notices, labels,  or
marks on the PRODUCT. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this
AGREEMENT shall not prevent or restrict you from  exercising
additional or  different  rights  to  any  portions  of  the
PRODUCT  that  are  Open  Source  Software.  To  the  extent
permitted by applicable law, you agree to  allow  CITRIX  to
audit your compliance with the terms of this AGREEMENT  upon
prior written notice and during normal business  hours,  but
no  more  than  once  per  year.   Any   audit   shall   not
unreasonably interfere with your  business  activities.  You
will reasonably cooperate with CITRIX and  the  auditor  and
will, without prejudice to other rights of  CITRIX,  address
any non-compliance identified by the audit,  including,  but
not limited to, promptly paying any fees owed. If the  audit
discloses an underpayment of ten percent (10%)  or  more  of
fees owed for the period audited or  other  material  breach
of this AGREEMENT, you agree to also  reimburse  CITRIX  for
the reasonable audit expenses. Note that a  PRODUCT  may  be
provided with identified  experimental  features  which  are
not part of  the  PRODUCT  and  which  are  not  covered  by
MAINTENANCE and the Limited  Warranty.   Such  features  are
offered AS IS and may never become part of  the  PRODUCT  or
any   CITRIX   commercial   product.    Citrix   makes    no
representations   or   certifications   with   respect    to
experimental features.

ALL  RIGHTS  IN  THE  PRODUCT  NOT  EXPRESSLY  GRANTED   ARE
RESERVED BY CITRIX  OR  ITS  LICENSORS.  CITRIX  and/or  its
licensors own and retain all  title  and  ownership  of  all
intellectual  property  rights  in  and  to   the   PRODUCT,
including  any  adaptations,  modifications,   translations,
derivative works or copies, and any relating to the  design,
manufacture, or operation of the same.

4.    INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION.  In  the  event  of  any
claim, suit, or proceeding brought against you based  on  an
allegation  that  a  PRODUCT,   experimental   features   or
consulting  deliverable  hereunder  (excluding  Open  Source
Software             unless             noted             at
http://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/product.html)  infringes
upon any patent, copyright or  trade  secret  of  any  third
party ("Infringement Claim"), CITRIX  shall  defend,  or  at
its option, settle, such Infringement Claim, and  shall  pay
all costs (including reasonable attorney's fees)  associated
with  the  defense  of  such  Infringement  Claim,  and  all
damages finally awarded or settlements undertaken by  CITRIX
in resolution of such Infringement Claim, provided you:  (i)
promptly notify CITRIX in writing of  your  notification  or
discovery of an Infringement Claim such that CITRIX  is  not
prejudiced by any delay  in  such  notification;  (ii)  give
CITRIX sole control over the defense or  settlement  of  the
Infringement Claim; and (iii) provide reasonable  assistance
in  the  defense  of  the  same.  Following  notice  of   an
Infringement Claim, or if CITRIX believes such  a  claim  is
likely, CITRIX may at  its  sole  expense  and  option:  (i)
procure for you the right to continue  to  use  the  alleged
infringing  PRODUCT,  experimental  feature  or   consulting
deliverable;   (ii)   replace   or   modify   the   PRODUCT,
experimental feature or consulting deliverable  to  make  it
non-infringing; or  (iii)  accept  return  of  the  PRODUCT,
experimental feature or consulting deliverable and, for  the
PRODUCT,  provide  you  with  a  prorated  refund  for   the
PRODUCT, using a three (3) year straight  line  depreciation
basis for the PRODUCT, or, for the  consulting  deliverable,
refund payments made for the deliverable. CITRIX assumes  no
liability,  and   shall   have   no   liability,   for   any
Infringement Claims or  allegations  of  infringement  based
on: (i) your use of any  PRODUCT,  experimental  feature  or
consulting deliverable after notice that  you  should  cease
use of such  PRODUCT,  experimental  feature  or  consulting
deliverable  due  to  an  Infringement   Claim;   (ii)   any
modification  of  the  PRODUCT,  experimental   feature   or
consulting deliverable by you or at  your  direction;  (iii)
your combination of the  PRODUCT,  experimental  feature  or
consulting deliverable with non-CITRIX  hardware,  software,
services,  data  or  other  content  or  materials  if  such
Infringement Claim would have been avoided  by  the  use  of
the PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting  deliverable
alone.  THE FOREGOING  STATES  YOUR  EXCLUSIVE  REMEDY  WITH
RESPECT  TO  ANY  INFRINGEMENT  CLAIM   OR   ALLEGATION   OF
INFRINGEMENT.

5.    LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. CITRIX warrants  that
for a period of  ninety  (90)  days  from  delivery  of  the
License Keys,  the  software  in  a  software  or  appliance
PRODUCT will perform substantially in  accordance  with  the
PRODUCT's documentation published  by  CITRIX  and  included
with the PRODUCT. Citrix warrants that for a period  of  one
(1) year from delivery of the License Keys, the hardware  in
an appliance PRODUCT, will be free from defects in  material
and workmanship in normal use. This hardware  warranty  does
not cover any of the following: (1)  improper  installation,

electrical power failures, surges, other  irregularities  or
water damage; (4) third party software or software  drivers;
or (5) damage to hardware during shipment  of  an  appliance
PRODUCT.  CITRIX   and   its   licensors'   and   suppliers'
("SUPPLIERS'") entire liability and  your  exclusive  remedy
under this software or hardware warranty (which  is  subject
to your return of the PRODUCT to  CITRIX  or  an  authorized
reseller) will be, at the sole option of CITRIX and  subject
to applicable law, to replace the PRODUCT or to  refund  the
purchase price and terminate your license  to  any  software
on the PRODUCT. CITRIX will provide  MAINTENANCE  (including
technical support and consulting services if  purchased)  in
a professional and workmanlike  manner,  but  CITRIX  cannot
guarantee that every question or problem raised by you  will
be resolved or resolved in a certain amount of time.  Citrix
does not warrant in any form the results or achievements  of
the  PRODUCT,  technical  support,  consulting  services  or
related deliverables. With  respect  to  technical  support,
CITRIX'  and  its  SUPPLIERS'  entire  liability  and   your
exclusive remedy under this warranty  is  re-performance  of
the services.  With respect to consulting services,  CITRIX'
and its  SUPPLIERS'  entire  liability  and  your  exclusive
remedy  under  this  warranty  is  re-performance   of   the
services  or,  if  re-performance   is   not   possible   or
conforming, refund of amounts paid  for  the  non-conforming
services.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE  LAW  AND  EXCEPT  FOR
THE ABOVE LIMITED WARRANTY, CITRIX AND  ITS  SUPPLIERS  MAKE
AND  YOU  RECEIVE  NO  WARRANTIES  OR  CONDITIONS,  EXPRESS,
IMPLIED,  STATUTORY,  OR  OTHERWISE;  AND  CITRIX  AND   ITS
SUPPLIERS  SPECIFICALLY  DISCLAIM  WITH   RESPECT   TO   THE
PRODUCT, ANY  EXPERIMENTAL  FEATURES,  MAINTENANCE  AND  ANY
OTHER  SOFTWARE  OR   SERVICE   DELIVERED   HEREUNDER,   ANY
CONDITIONS OF QUALITY, AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY,  SECURITY,
LACK  OF  VIRUSES,  BUGS,  OR  ERRORS,   AND   ANY   IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY  WARRANTY  OF
TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET  POSSESSION,  MERCHANTABILITY,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  THE
PRODUCT AND  MAINTENANCE  ARE  NOT  DESIGNED,  MANUFACTURED,
DELIVERED OR INTENDED FOR ANY USE WHERE FAILURE  COULD  LEAD
DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR  SEVERE  PHYSICAL  OR
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. YOU ASSUME  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR  THEIR
SELECTION TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS,  AND  FOR  THEIR
INSTALLATION, USE, AND RESULTS OBTAINED THEREFROM.

6.    EXPORT  RESTRICTION.  You  agree  that  you  will  not
export, re-export, or import  the  PRODUCT,  MAINTENANCE  or
any other software or service  delivered  hereunder  in  any
form  without  the  appropriate  government  licenses.   You
understand that under  no  circumstances  may  the  PRODUCT,
MAINTENANCE or  any  other  software  or  service  delivered
hereunder  be  exported  to  any  country  subject  to  U.S.
embargo or to U.S.-designated denied persons  or  prohibited
entities or U.S. specially designated nationals.

7.     LIMITATION   OF   LIABILITY.   EXCEPT   FOR   CITRIX'
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH  IN  SECTION
4, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU  AGREE
THAT  NEITHER  CITRIX  NOR  ITS  AFFILIATES,  SUPPLIERS,  OR
AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS SHALL BE  LIABLE  FOR  ANY  LOSS  OF
DATA OR PRIVACY, LOSS OF  INCOME,  LOSS  OF  OPPORTUNITY  OR
PROFITS, COST OF RECOVERY, LOSS, HOWEVER CAUSED AND  ON  ANY
THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF  THE  PRODUCT,
EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES, MAINTENANCE OR ANY OTHER SOFTWARE  OR
SERVICE DELIVERED HEREUNDER, OR  DAMAGE  ARISING  FROM  YOUR
USE OF THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS OR  HARDWARE,  OR  ANY  SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES  ARISING  OUT
OF  OR  IN  CONNECTION  WITH   THIS   AGREEMENT,   OR   YOUR
EXPORTATION, REEXPORTATION, OR IMPORTATION OF ANY OR ALL  OF
THE SAME. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY  EVEN  IF  CITRIX,  ITS
AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, OR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS HAVE  BEEN
ADVISED OF  THE  POSSIBILITY  OF  SUCH  DAMAGES,  AND  THESE
LIMITATIONS  WILL  APPLY  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  FAILURE   OF
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY  LIMITED  REMEDY  PROVIDED  HEREIN.
EXCEPT FOR  CITRIX'  INDEMNIFICATION  OBLIGATIONS  EXPRESSLY
SET    FORTH    IN    SECTION    4    (UNLESS    NOTED    AT
http://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/product.html),  AND   TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN  NO  EVENT  SHALL
THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY  OF  CITRIX,  ITS  AFFILIATES,
SUPPLIERS, OR  AUTHORIZED  DISTRIBUTORS  EXCEED  THE  AMOUNT
PAID FOR THE  PRODUCT,  EXPERIMENTAL  FEATURES,  MAINTENANCE
TERM,  CONSULTING  DELIVERABLE  OR  ANY  OTHER  SOFTWARE  OR
SERVICE DELIVERED HEREUNDER AT ISSUE. YOU  ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT
THE PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE FEES REFLECT  THESE  ALLOCATIONS
OF RISK. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE  LIMITATION  OR
EXCLUSION  OF  LIABILITY  FOR  INCIDENTAL  OR  CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT  APPLY
TO  YOU.  For  purposes  of   this   AGREEMENT,   the   term
"AFFILIATE" shall mean any entity that  controls,  is  under
common control with,  or  is  controlled  by  CITRIX,  where
"control" means the ownership,  direct  or  indirect,  of  a
majority  of  CITRIX'  stock  or  other  interest   entitled
allowing  the  owner  to  direct  the  affairs  of   CITRIX.
AFFILIATES,  suppliers,  and  authorized  distributors   are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this  AGREEMENT.


8.    TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL. This AGREEMENT is  effective
until terminated. You may terminate this  AGREEMENT  at  any
time by removing the software of  your  software  PRODUCT(s)
from your  computers  and  destroying  all  copies,  and  by
removing the software of your appliance PRODUCT(s) from  the
hardware, and then providing written notice to  CITRIX  with
the  serial  numbers  of  your  License  Keys.  CITRIX   may
terminate this AGREEMENT at any  time  for  your  breach  of
this AGREEMENT. Unauthorized copying of the  software  in  a
software  or  appliance  PRODUCT  or  the  Documentation  or
otherwise failing  to  comply  with  the  license  grant  or
restrictions of this  AGREEMENT  will  result  in  automatic
termination of this AGREEMENT and  will  make  available  to
CITRIX all other legal remedies. You agree  and  acknowledge
that your material breach  of  this  AGREEMENT  shall  cause
CITRIX irreparable harm for  which  monetary  damages  alone
would be inadequate and that, to  the  extent  permitted  by
applicable law, CITRIX shall be entitled  to  injunctive  or
equitable relief without the need for posting a  bond.  Upon
termination of this AGREEMENT, the PRODUCT licenses  granted
hereunder will terminate and you  must  immediately  destroy
the software in a software  or  appliance  PRODUCT  and  the
Documentation,  and  all   backup   copies   thereof.    Any
termination  of  consulting  services  is  subject  to   the
applicable scope definition, and you shall pay for  services
provided prior to the termination.  All purchases are  final
with  no  right  of  return,  and  neither  CITRIX  nor  any
reseller or distributor will be obligated to pay,  nor  will
you be due, any refund of amounts paid by  you,  other  than
under the Limited Warranty or  Infringement  Indemnification
terms of this AGREEMENT. Those provisions of this  AGREEMENT
which are intended by the parties to survive  shall  survive
termination   of   this   AGREEMENT,    including    without
limitation, the Limitation of Liability terms.

Documentation by the U.S. Government or any of its  agencies
is governed by,  and  is  subject  to,  all  of  the  terms,

standard commercial license AGREEMENT. If, for  any  reason,
FAR 12.212  or  DFARS  227.7202-1  or  227.7202-3  or  these
license  terms  are  deemed  not  applicable,   you   hereby
acknowledge that the Government's right to  use,  duplicate,
or disclose  the  software  and  related  Documentation  are
"Restricted Rights" as defined in  48  CFR  Section  52.227-
14(a) (May 2014) or DFARS  252.227-7014(a)(15)  (Feb  2014),

other purposes consistent with the Citrix Privacy Policy  at

11.    AUTHORIZED   DISTRIBUTORS   AND   RESELLERS.   CITRIX
authorized distributors and resellers do not have the  right
to make modifications to  this  AGREEMENT  or  to  make  any
additional  representations,  commitments,   or   warranties
